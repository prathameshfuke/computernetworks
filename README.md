## 📂 Project Explanations

### 1. DNS, DHCP, and HTTP Server Configuration

This project demonstrates how to configure three essential network services in an integrated environment:

- **DNS Server:** Assigns friendly domain names to IP addresses. Learn how to set up a DNS zone, add records, and verify resolution from a client PC.
- **DHCP Server:** Assigns IP addresses automatically to clients on the network. You will configure the server, define IP pools, and see how computers receive their addresses.
- **HTTP Server:** Makes a website available over the network. Configure the server, place web content, and test accessibility via a web browser on a client device.

**Skills Practiced:** IP addressing, Name resolution, Service testing using ping/nslookup/browser.

### 2. DNS Configuration

Focuses solely on the setup and testing of a DNS server in a computer network:

- Add domain and host records.
- Configure network clients to use your DNS server.
- Use tools like `nslookup` to verify domain-to-IP and IP-to-domain mapping works as intended.

**Skills Practiced:** DNS record management, troubleshooting name resolution.

### 3. HTTP Server Configuration

Shows how to make a local website accessible to other PCs in the network:

- Set up a server running HTTP service.
- Place sample web pages in the server.
- Test access and adjust firewall or routing settings as needed for successful communication.

**Skills Practiced:** Web server administration, HTTP basics, browser network diagnostics.

### 4. TELNET on Router

Learn how to remotely manage routers from anywhere in your network:

- Enable and secure Telnet access on a router.
- From a client PC, use telnet commands to connect, login, and issue configuration commands to the router.

**Skills Practiced:** Remote CLI management, VTY lines, router security basics.

***

### 5. TELNET on Switch

Applies the same principles as the router lab, but with a network switch:

- Enable Telnet on a switch.
- Remotely log in from a PC to manage and configure switch ports and features.

**Skills Practiced:** Switch CLI management, enabling remote access, user privilege levels.

### 6. WLAN Configuration

Builds a basic wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) in Packet Tracer:

- Add a wireless router or access point.
- Configure SSID, security (WPA2, passwords), and connect PCs/laptops via wireless.
- Troubleshoot signal and authentication issues.

**Skills Practiced:** Wireless networking, encryption, connecting different device types.
